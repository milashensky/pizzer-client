export default function About () {
    return (
        <div className="main">
            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                If you do not get it yet, it is not real pizza delivery service.
                Actually I am more in bad puns business then in pizzas.
                This site is just example of react app.
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}
